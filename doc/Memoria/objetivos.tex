\chapter{Objectives}
\label{chap:objectives}

\drop{I}{n} this chapter the main objective, as well as the specific objectives that must be achieved to complete this work are explained.

\section{Main objective}
\label{chap:main-objective} 
The main objective of this \ac{BSc.} thesis is the analysis, design and implementation of an inexpensive distributed architecture based on Raspberry Pi embedded systems to monitor simultaneously the road traffic and the air pollution in urban areas. The purpose of this hardware-software system is to support the acquisition of data about the pollution level, in conjunction with traffic flows information on multiple points of a city in real time. 


\section{Specific objectives}
The main objective is expected to be fulfilled through the achievement of the following sub-objectives:

		\textbf{O.1}& Develop a traffic monitoring device based on Raspberry Pi. This system has to be equipped with a camera sensor and video analysis software to collect vehicle’s counts.  \\
		
		\textbf{O.2}& Develop a module to obtain environmental parameters on the Raspberry Pi System.  \\
		
		\textbf{O.3}& Develop a cloud service to communicate and synchronize the data from the different Raspberry Pi devices.  \\
		
		\textbf{O.4}& Develop a front-end using BlueMix platform to monitor the data recorded by the different Raspberry Pi devices and control them.  \\
