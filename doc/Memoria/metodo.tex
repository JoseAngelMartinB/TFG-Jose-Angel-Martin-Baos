\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chap:methodology}

\drop{I}{n} order to carry out this project, a working methodology should be chosen and followed throughout the development of this \ac{BSc.} thesis. In particular, \emword{Scrum} is used as project management methodology and \emword{Kanban} is adopted to manage the progress of the project. In addition, the iterative and incremental software development methodology is used, where the product is developed in several increments and each increment is executed in iterative cycles. To end with, the details of the different means and resources used are also described.


\section{Agile methodologies}
In the last few years, the number of companies, with different size and from different areas, using agile development methodologies have increased considerably. These methodologies are not only used by the software development companies, but also they are used by a wide range of companies. In the software engineering field, agile methodologies gained a lot of importance due to the complexity sometimes needed to specify the different requirements of a product in an unique phase. Agile methodologies make a great difference with respect to \emword{Waterfall} model where carrying out a change once the product is almost finished is very costly.

In an agile project it is sought to divide the tasks of the software project in increments with a minimum planning and a short duration (normally between one and four weeks). Each iteration produces an operational prototype that is revised together with the client. Therefore, we can affirm that the life cycle of the agile methodologies is iterative and incremental.

Some examples of agile methodologies could be:
\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emword{Scrum} \cite{ScrumGuide}
		\item Adaptive Software Development \\ \cite{ASD}
		\item Extreme Programming (XP) \cite{XPProgramming}
		\item Open Unified Process (OpenUP) \\ \cite{Bal07}
		\item Feature-Driven Development \cite{FDD}
		\item Lean \cite{PP03}
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

In April 2017 the \emph{11th annual state or agile survey} \cite{AnualStateAgile} produced a listing with the most applied agile methodologies as shown in Figure \ref{fig:5-AgileMethodologyUsed}. The most used agile methodology is \emword{Scrum} with a 58\% of the total number of organizations using such methodology.

In our view, \emword{Scrum} fits nicely with the problem dealt in this \ac{BSc.} thesis as this project consist on a hardware-software system organised in several stages. Furthermore, as consequence of being one of the most used agile methodologies, lot of literature has been written about it, for this reason, \emword{Scrum} has been chosen. Specifically, \emword{Scrum} methodology \cite{ScrumGuide} has been adapted to an one-person development. To manage the progress of the project graphically the Kanban technique with the tool Trello\footnote{Trello website: \url{www.trello.com} \label{footnote-1}} is used.

\end{figure}

Now, a general description of \emword{Scrum} is exposed.


\subsection{Scrum}
\emword{Scrum} \cite{ScrumGuide} is an agile project management methodology not necessarily related with software projects. \emword{Scrum} has two main characteristics: The first one is that the development of the software is carried out in incremental iterations, whilst the second one is that coordination meetings are held throughout the project.
In \emword{Scrum}, the product is developed in series with a duration from one to four weeks called \emword{Sprints}. The different requirements are captured as elements of a list called \emword{product backlog} which is created at the beginning of the project. Figure \ref{fig:5-ScrumSprints} represents the complete \emword{Scrum} life cycle.

\begin{figure}[!h]

		\label{fig:5-ScrumSprints}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Scrum Team} \label{5-ScrumTeam}
\emword{Scrum} Teams are self-organizing, cross-functional, non-distributed and must have an optimal size. The team model in \emword{Scrum} is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity and its different roles are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emlst{Product owner.} The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the	development team. This person is also responsible of establishing the user stories, assigning them a priority and classifying them in the product backlog. The product owner must have a very clear perspective of the product which will be developed and must transmit it to the development team.
	
	\item \emlst{Scrum master.} The Scrum master is responsible for ensuring that the \emword{Scrum} is understood by all the members and that the \emword{Scrum} team adheres to \emword{Scrum} theory, practices, and rules. 
	
	\item \emlst{Development team.} The development team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. It is recommended that they work full time, in the same place and they should not change during a Sprint.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{The Sprint}
In agile methodologies, the requirements that must fit the software which will be developed are collected into user stories. The user stories \cite{Coh04} are a brief description of the software functionality as the user perceives them. A Sprint is a time block with a duration from one to four weeks in which a product increment is obtained. Therefore, each Sprint can be considered as a project itself. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint. The \emph{Sprint goal} is the objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of product backlog. No changes can be made in the Sprint goal during the Sprint execution. 


\subsubsection{Scrum events}
Some events are planned with a fixed duration and a concrete objective in order to minimize the need for meetings not defined previously. These events are the following ones:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emlst{Sprint planning meeting.} It consists of a meeting carried out at the start of each Sprint where the elements from the product backlog to be developed are selected. Therefore, the Sprint backlog is created. This meeting should not last more than one day.
	
	\item \emlst{Daily Scrum.} It consists of daily meetings with a duration of less than fifteen minutes where the development team can synchronize their activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the work since the last daily Scrum and forecasting the work that could be done before the next one.
	
	\item \emlst{Sprint review.} It consists of a informal meeting held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog if needed. During the Sprint review, the Scrum team and the stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint.
	
	\item \emlst{Sprint retrospective.} It is an opportunity for the Scrum team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. It has a maximum duration of three hours and takes place between the Sprint review meeting and the next Sprint planning meeting.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Scrum artefacts}
When using \emword{Scrum}, some outputs are obtained known as \emword{Artefacts}. They represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. Figure \ref{fig:5-ScrumSprints} shows the different artefacts and the moment in the Scrum life cycle when they are obtained.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emlst{Product backlog.} It consists of an ordered list of requirements or user stories that will be included in the software product in the increments. This list, which is created by the Product owner, is never complete, therefore, it can change during the project to identify what the product needs. 
	
	\item \emlst{Sprint backlog.} It is a subset of the elements contained in the product backlog. It consists of an ordered list of user stories to be developed during this Sprint.
	
	\item \emlst{Product increment.} The increment is the sum of all the product backlog items that has been completed during a Sprint and add value to the increments of all the previous Sprints.
\end{itemize}

Heretofore, \emword{Scrum} project management methodology has been explained, besides the team needed for using it, the events organized and the artefacts produced. In the next section Kanban technique will be explained.


\section{Kanban}
Kanban \cite{Gar11,KS10} is a Japanese technique for managing the progress of the project. It was invented by Toyota and was used to control the progress of their work in the production line. Therefore, Kanban is not a specific software development technique, nevertheless, in the last few years it has been used in the management of software projects.

Kanban allows the development team to visualize the workflow of the different tasks. Normally, consists in using a slate board with three columns: \emph{To Do}, \emph{Doing} and \emph{Done}, that represents the different phases a task passes until it is completed. Each task in which a Sprint is divided is considered as a card which is put into the slate board. An example of this concept can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:5-KanbanBoard}.

To manage the Kanban Board, Trello is used, as it was previously indicated. This tool allows the creation of several boards. In each board many columns can be created with various tasks that can be moved from one column to another by means of a very friendly interface.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\begin{center}

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Up to this time, the project management methodology has been presented. Now, the development methodology will be introduced.


\section{Development methodology}
The development methodology is used by developers and engineers to write code, helping them in the process and giving some guidelines when developing computer systems in order to maintain a high code quality. In this \ac{BSc.} thesis the iterative and incremental software development methodology is used. In this method of software development the project is divided into several blocks, which match with the temporal blocks defined in \emword{Scrum} \cite{ItIncr}. 

Each iteration of the iterative and incremental methodology can be considered as a project itself where a value must be added to the final product. For each of those iterations all the tasks necessary to complete it must be executed, incorporating analysis, design, coding and testing phases (this is the reason of being called iterative). Moreover, in each iteration the team must take the work done in the previous iterations and include new objectives and requirements or improve the ones that are already accomplished (this is the reason of being called incremental). Figure \ref{fig:5-Iterative-and-incremental} represents the iterative and incremental methodology flow.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{5-Iterative-and-incremental.jpg}
		\caption{Iterative and incremental methodology flow}
		\label{fig:5-Iterative-and-incremental}{Adapted from  \url{http://www.technologyuk.net}}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Some of the advantages of using the iterative and incremental methodology are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The final product is more adjusted to the client needs due to the fact that in each iteration part of the product is obtained and can be checked by the client. Therefore, some adjustments can be made in the following iterations.
	
	\item The changes that may appear during the project can be managed easier.
	
	\item Functional results are obtained from the firsts iterations.
	
	\item The client tends to involve itself more in the project. 
\end{itemize}

However, some disadvantages should be commented:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The result of each iteration must be a useful product, so that the result is really satisfactory for the client.
	
	\item Each of the steps in an iteration are fixed and iterations cannot be overlapped.
	
	\item Some techniques must be used in order to accomplish changes in the product easily, without incrementing the complexity of the project.
\end{itemize}
