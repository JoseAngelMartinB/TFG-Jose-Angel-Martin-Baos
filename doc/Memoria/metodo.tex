\drop{I}{n} order to carry out this project, a working methodology should be choosen and followed throughout the development of this \ac{TFG}. In particular, Scrum has been used as project management methodology and Kanban to manage the progress of the project. The details of the different means and resources that has been used are also described.


\section{Agile methodologies}

In the last few years, the number of companies of different size and from different areas which are using agile development methodologies has increased. These methodologies are not only used by the software development companies, but they are used by any kind of company. In the software engineering field, agile methodologies gain a lot of importance due to the complexity sometimes required to specify the different requirements of a product in a unique phase. The agile methodologies makes a great difference with respect to Waterfall model, where carry out a change once the product is almost finished is very costly.

In a agile project it is sought to divide the task of the software project in increments with a minimum planning and a short duration (normally between 1 and 4 weeks). Each iteration produces an operational prototype that is revised together with the client. Therefore, we can say that the life cycle of the agile methodologies is iterative and incremental.

Some examples of agile methodologies are:
\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Scrum
		\item Adaptive Software Development
		\item Extreme Programming (XP)
		\item Open Unified Process (OpenUP)
		\item Feature-Driven Development
		\item Lean
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

The \emph{11th anual state or agile survey} \cite{AnualStateAgile} (elaborated in April 2017) has elaborated a listing with the most used agile methodologies which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:5-AgileMethodologyUsed}. The most used agile methodology is Scrum which is used by the 58\% of the organizations that use agile methodologies. 

Due to the fact that is the most used agile methodology and that it fits perfectly with the problem dealt in this \ac{TFG}, Scrum has been choosen. Specifically, Scrum methodology \cite{ScrumGuide} has been adapted to an unipersonal development. To manage the progress of the project graphically use the Kanban technique with the tool Trello.\footnote{Trello website: \url{www.trello.com} \label{footnote-1}}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Scrum}

Scrum \cite{ScrumGuide} is an agile project management methodology, but not necessarily related with software projects. Scrum has two main characteristics: The development of the software is carried out in incremental iterations and coordination meetings are held throughout the project.
Figure \ref{fig:5-ScrumSprints} represents the Scrum life cycle.\footnote{Image taken and modified from \url{https://www.visualstudio.com/es/learn/what-is-scrum}} In Scrum, the product is developed in series with a duration of 1 to 4 weeks called \emph{sprints}. The requirements are captured as elements of a list called \emph{product backlog}.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Scrum Team} \label{5-ScrumTeam}
Scrum Teams are self-organizing, cross-functional, non-distributed and with an optimal size. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity. The different roles in Scrum are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Product Owner. Is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the	Development Team. This person is also responsible of establishing the user stories, assigning them a priority and classifying them in the Product Backlog. The product Owner must have a very clear perspective of the product which will be developed and must transmit it to the development team.
	
	\item Scrum Master. Is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. Scrum Masters do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules. 
	
	\item Development Team. Consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. It is recommended that they work full time, in the same place and they should not change during a sprint.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{The Sprint}

In agile methodologies, the requirements that must fit the software which will be developed are collected into user stories. The user stories are a brief description of the software functionality as the user perceives them. \cite{Coh04} A Sprint is a time bloc with a duration of one to four weeks in which a product increment is obtained. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint. During the Sprint no changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal (objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog). Each Sprints can be considered as a project itself, with a duration, as mentioned previously, between one and 4 weeks.


\subsubsection{Scrum Events}
Some events are planned when using Scrum with a fixed duration and concrete objective in order to minimize the need for meetings not defined. These events are the following ones:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sprint planning meeting. Consists on a meeting realized at the start of each Sprint where the elements from the Product Backlog that will be developed are selected. Therefore, the Sprint Backlog is created. It should not last more than one day.
	
	\item Daily Scrum. Consist on daily meetings with a duration of less than fifteen minutes where the development team can synchronize their activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that could be done before the next one.
	
	\item Sprint Review. Consist on a informal meeting held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint.
	
	\item Sprint Retrospective. It is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. It has a maximum duration of three hours and takes places between the Sprint Review meeting and the next Sprint planning meeting.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Scrum Artifacts}
When using Scrum, some outputs are obtained known as Artifacts. They represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. In Figure \ref{fig:5-ScrumSprints} it can be shown the different artifacts and when are they obtained.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Product Backlog. Consist on an ordered list of requirements or user stories that will be included in the software product in the increments. This list is created by the Product Owner. This list is never complete, therefore, it can change during the project to identify what the product needs. 
	
	\item Sprint Backlog. It is a subset of the elements contained in the Product Backlog. Consist on an ordered list of user stories that will be developed during this Sprint.
	
	\item Product increment. The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items that has been completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all the previous Sprints.
\end{itemize}


\section{Kanban}

Kanban \cite{Gar11,KS10} is a Japanese technique for managing the progress of the project. It was invented by Toyota and was used to control de progresses of their work in the production line. Therefore, Kanban is not a specific software development technique, nevertheless, in the last few years it has been used in the management of software projects.

Kanban allows the development team to visualize the workflow of the different task. Normally, consists on using a slate board with three colums: \emph{To Do}, \emph{Doing} and \emph{Done}, which represents the different phases that a task passes until it has been completed. Each task in which a sprint is divided is considered as a card which is put into the slate board. An example of this concept can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:5-KanbanBoard}.\footnote{Image from \url{www.qe2ingenieria.com}}

To manage the Kanban Board Trello has ben used, as it was previously commented. This tool allow creating several boards. In each board many columns can be created with various task that can be moved from one column to another using a very friendly interface.
